# BIPVT Solar Collector – Design Enhancement
![BIPVT Solar Collector](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FaisalAEng/portfolio-website/main/Projects/BIPVT_Collector.jpg)

**Capstone Project**  

## Project Overview
This capstone project involved redesigning key airflow components of a hybrid building-integrated photovoltaic and thermal (BIPV/T) solar air collector to enhance heat transfer and thermal performance. The work focused on controlling airflow behavior through inlet geometry and internal features to promote turbulence, enabling more effective heat extraction from the PV panels for residential and industrial applications.

## What I Did
- Redesigned airflow path using baffles and optimized inlet geometry.
- Simulated airflow and thermal performance using CAD and heat transfer calculations.
- Evaluated thermal performance: achieved outlet air temperature increase of **8.7°C**.
- Produced technical documentation with design rationale, performance metrics, and implementation recommendations.

## Why It Matters
Improving the thermal efficiency of BIPV/T systems contributes to higher energy capture, reduced operating costs, and more sustainable energy solutions for buildings.

## Files Included
- CAD models of redesigned airflow components
- Simulation reports
- Technical design documents

## Key Skills
CAD (SolidWorks, OnShape), Thermal Analysis, Heat Transfer, Design Optimization, Technical Documentation
