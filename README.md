# BIPVT Solar Collector – Design Enhancement
![BIPVT Solar Collector](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FaisalAEng/portfolio-website/main/Projects/BIPVT_Collector.jpg)

**Capstone Project**  

## Project Overview
This capstone project focused on redesigning part of a hybrid building-integrated photovoltaic and thermal (BIPV/T) solar air collector to improve airflow and heat transfer. The project demonstrates how careful manipulation of air inlets and turbulence-driven design can enhance thermal performance in residential and industrial applications.

## What I Did
- Redesigned airflow path using baffles and optimized inlet geometry.
- Simulated airflow and thermal performance using CAD and heat transfer calculations.
- Evaluated thermal performance: achieved outlet air temperature increase of **8.7°C**.
- Produced technical documentation with design rationale, performance metrics, and implementation recommendations.

## Why It Matters
Improving the thermal efficiency of BIPV/T systems contributes to higher energy capture, reduced operating costs, and more sustainable energy solutions for buildings.

## Files Included
- CAD models of redesigned airflow components
- Simulation reports
- Technical design documents

## Key Skills
CAD (SolidWorks, OnShape), Thermal Analysis, Heat Transfer, Design Optimization, Technical Documentation
